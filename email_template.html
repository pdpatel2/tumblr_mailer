    <p>Hi FIRST_NAME,</p>
    <br>
    <p>
      How have you been? I'm doing pretty well. It's been about NUM_MONTHS_SINCE_CONTACT week(s) since we last talked. I'm learning to code full-time at Grace Hopper Academy and enjoying my time.

      I wrote a blog about what inspired me to code. Look at my most recent posts:

      I sent this email to you using a node.js script file, which sent this email to a list of specified contacts. Full disclosure, it was pretty hard, but I was successfully able to send this file to you, so that's promising. Hope you enjoyed the post, and I'll talk to you soon!

      Talk soon,<br>
